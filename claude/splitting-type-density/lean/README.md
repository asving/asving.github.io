# SurfaceBlowup — factorization-type densities over complete DVRs

A Lean 4 / Mathlib formalization of the following theorem. Let `O` be a complete discrete valuation
ring with finite residue field of cardinality `q` (any characteristic, any ramification). For every
`n` and every factorization type `σ`, the probability that a Haar-random monic polynomial of degree
`n` over `O` (resp. a random primitive binary form of degree `n`) factors over `Frac O` with type
`σ` equals `A_{n,σ}(q)` (resp. `R_{n,σ}(q)`), where `A_{n,σ}`, `R_{n,σ}` are explicit universal
rational functions, given by a finite recursion over blow-ups of a regular arithmetic surface.
A second result is a reciprocity law for these rational functions.

## Main theorems

All in namespace `SurfaceBlowup`:

| theorem | file | statement (informal) |
|---|---|---|
| `main_dvr` | `SurfaceBlowup/Main.lean` | for `O` as above (adic topology, Borel σ-algebra, normalized Haar measure): `monicDensity O n σ = densityValue (monicExpr n σ) q` and `projectiveDensity O n σ = densityValue (projectiveExpr n σ) q` |
| `main_field_form` | `SurfaceBlowup/Main.lean` | the published rational-function form for rings of integers of unramified finite `K/ℚ_p` |
| `main_field_form_ramified` | `SurfaceBlowup/Main.lean` | the same for arbitrary finite `K/ℚ_p` |
| `recip_main` | `SurfaceBlowup/Reciprocity/Main.lean` | reciprocity: `A_n(q) = B_n(1/q)` and `R_n(1/q) = R_n(q)` |
| `main_dvr_cluster` (v1.1) | `SurfaceBlowup/Cluster/Main.lean` | the cluster clause: `clusterDensity O n σ = densityValue (clusterExpr n σ) q`, where `clusterDensity` is the normalized Haar probability on monic polynomials reducing to `X^n` and `clusterExpr n σ = lawCoeff (rootLaw n) σ` is `B_{n,σ}` |
| `cluster_formula_regular`, `recip_cluster` (v1.1) | `SurfaceBlowup/Cluster/Main.lean` | `B_{n,σ}` is regular at every prime power; `A_{n,σ}(q) = B_{n,σ}(1/q)` in the paper's notation |
| `main_dvr_etale` (v1.1) | `SurfaceBlowup/Etale/Main.lean` | the monic and projective laws with the events restricted to étale algebras (`etaleMonicDensity`, `etaleProjectiveDensity`); with `monicDensity_eq_etale`, `projectiveDensity_eq_etale`, `clusterDensity_eq_etale` and `binary_nonEtale_null`: the reduced-algebra and étale type conventions agree off a Haar-null set |
| `universal_type_laws` (v1.2) | `SurfaceBlowup/Corollaries/RationalForm.lean` | Theorem 1.1 in one statement: there are `A, B, R : RatFunc ℚ` (the rational functions of `monicExpr`, `clusterExpr`, `projectiveExpr`), regular and nonnegative at every prime power, such that over every `O` as above each of the three densities satisfies `0 ≤ r ∧ density = ENNReal.ofReal r` with `r` the value at `q` given by `RatFunc.eval` |
| `monicExpr_eval_nonneg`, `projectiveExpr_eval_nonneg`, `clusterExpr_eval_nonneg` (v1.2) | `SurfaceBlowup/Corollaries/Nonneg.lean` | the universal expressions take nonnegative values at every prime power, so the `ENNReal.ofReal` in `main_dvr` and `main_dvr_cluster` never clamps; `main_dvr_toReal`, `main_dvr_cluster_toReal` are the real-valued forms |
| `cluster_rational_eval` (v1.2) | `SurfaceBlowup/Corollaries/RationalForm.lean` | `RatFunc.eval q (clusterExpr n σ).rational = (clusterExpr n σ).eval q` at prime powers (the cluster analogue of `global_rational_eval`) |
| `reciprocity_recipRat`, `reciprocity_ringHom`, `recip_main_all_degrees` (v1.2) | `SurfaceBlowup/Corollaries/RationalForm.lean` | reciprocity in every degree, including `n = 0`: `A = v(B)` and `v(R) = R` for the ring endomorphism `v` of `ℚ(q)` with `v(q) = q⁻¹`; `clusterExpr_subst_inv_rational` identifies the syntactic right side of `recip_main` with `v(B)` |

Compared with the certified (owner-signed) statements, the hypotheses `0 < n`, `ValidType σ`,
`typeDegree σ = n` of `main_dvr` / `main_field_form` / `main_field_form_ramified` and `ValidType σ`,
`typeDegree σ = n` of `recip_main` were dropped in cycle 4a (none was used by the proofs), so the
theorems are strictly stronger; `0 < n` of `recip_main` is used and kept. `Checks/run_checks.sh`
derives each certified statement, with its extra hypotheses, from the unified theorem in the kernel.

## Trust boundary

Lean checks proofs, not statements. Everything a reader must audit to trust the theorems is in
**`SurfaceBlowup/Basic.lean`** (~500 lines): the definitions of factorization types, the rational
expressions `Expr`, laws, recursion states, `stateLaw`, `monicExpr`, `projectiveExpr`, the densities
`monicDensity`, `projectiveDensity`, and `densityValue`, plus the main-theorem statements themselves
in `Main.lean` / `Reciprocity/Main.lean`. Version 1.1 extends the boundary by two short files of
definitions, **`SurfaceBlowup/Cluster/Defs.lean`** (`clusterCell`, `clusterExpr`, `clusterDensity`) and
**`SurfaceBlowup/Etale/Defs.lean`** (`IsEtaleForm`, `etaleMonicDensity`, `etaleProjectiveDensity`), and the
statements in `Cluster/Main.lean` / `Etale/Main.lean`. Every other file only contains proofs and auxiliary
definitions that do not occur in the main statements.

Version 1.2 adds no definition to the boundary. The corollaries in `SurfaceBlowup/Corollaries/` are stated
with the definitions above and Mathlib's `RatFunc.eval`. `reciprocity_recipRat` also mentions `recipRat`
(`Reciprocity/Defs.lean`), the ring endomorphism `q ↦ q⁻¹` of `ℚ(q)`; `reciprocity_ringHom` states the same
fact without it. These corollaries were written after the release of v1.1.0.

`Checks/run_checks.sh` verifies, at the kernel level, that the statements of `main_dvr`,
`recip_main` and `main_field_form` as certified in the original one-theorem-per-file trees
(`final/monolith_gen`, `final/monolith_recip`, `final/monolith`; read-only) follow from the unified
theorems: it loads both environments in one Lean process, pairs every certified constant in the
closure of the certified statement with an alpha-identical unified constant, checks that the
conclusions are constant-for-constant identical and that the unified hypotheses are a subsequence of
the certified ones (the rest being the dropped propositions), and type-checks
`certified_statement := fun x₀ … => unified_theorem …` (implication form).

The regression guards in `Tests/` pin the definitions to known numbers, e.g.
`(monicExpr 4 {(4,1)}).eval 2 = 107/1533`, and derive density corollaries from `main_dvr`.
`Tests/Cluster.lean` derives the quadratic cluster law (`q/(q+1)`, `1/(2(q+1))`, `1/(2(q+1))`) from
`main_dvr_cluster`. `Tests/NonVacuity.lean` shows that the hypotheses of `main_dvr` are satisfiable in equal
characteristic: `𝔽_q⟦X⟧` with the coefficientwise topology, giving the formulas for `𝔽_p⟦X⟧`.
`Tests/PadicInt.lean` (v1.2) does the same in mixed characteristic: `ℤ_[p]` with Mathlib's norm topology,
which it proves to be the `(p)`-adic one, giving `main_dvr_padicInt`. No ramified extension of `ℤ_p` is
instantiated.

## Quality status

- 0 `sorry`/`admit`/`axiom`/`native_decide`, 0 `maxHeartbeats` options, 0 lines over 100 characters,
  no file over 1500 lines.
- Build warnings: 0.
- No module imports all of Mathlib (`import Mathlib`); every module imports only the Mathlib files it
  needs (cycle 4d).
- Mathlib standard linter set (`-Dweak.linter.mathlibStandardSet=true`): 0 hits (`tools/lint_census.sh`).
- No file-level `open Classical`: classical decidability is introduced per proof (`classical`) or per
  declaration (`open scoped Classical in`) exactly where a statement needs it.
- Every proof body is at most ~91 lines; the 5 declarations of 101-120 lines all have statements of
  11-57 lines (table: `logs/longest_decls_c4c.tsv`).
- Slowest modules (clean build, cycle 4c): `TwoChartCurveData` 67 s, `DivisorPoints` 66 s,
  `CurveOrders` 43 s, `Charts` 38 s (cycle 4a: 117, 86, 99, 152 s). No heartbeat options; the
  `TwoChartCurveData` proofs pass with `maxHeartbeats 85000`.

## Module hierarchy

Dependencies flow roughly top to bottom. Each module has a docstring with its main results.

- `Basic` — statement-level definitions (trust boundary).
- `Formula/` — the combinatorial side: law algebra and children of tangent patterns
  (`LawAlgebra`), ranks/safety of the recursion (`StateCombinatorics`), evaluation of the universal
  rational functions (`RationalEval`), finite-field counts (`FiniteFieldCounts`), divisor counts by
  tangent pattern (`PatternCounts`), transport of types and cell measures (`TypeTransport`).
- `Algebra/` — algebra types and integral closures over a DVR (`AlgebraType`), invariance of factor
  invariants (`FactorInvariant`).
- `Measure/` — adic cylinders and division charts, adic congruences and perturbations
  (`AdicTransport`), Hensel factorization and coefficient measures, Haar measures, atlases and state volumes, residue-ideal counts, member charts and boxes, the
  primitive locus.
- `Unramified/` — binary forms, factor cells, unramified extensions and Frobenius descent,
  polynomial types under base change, homogeneous cells.
- `Surfaces/` — the concrete surfaces `O⟦T, X⟧/(π − u·T^a·X^b)` (`u` a unit): lengths, power
  series structure, completeness, regularity, truncations, chart completions, closed points, ideal
  atlases, strict transforms and volumes.
- `Blowup/` — the point blow-up: closed directions and divisors on the exceptional line
  (`Directions`, depends only on `Basic`), charts and the exceptional line, curve orders,
  exceptional layers, point transport, nilpotent gluing, Čech comparison of global sections, strict transforms and the
  strict normalizer, curve sections, two-chart curve data, divisor points, and the bijection of
  strict transforms of a fixed tangent cell (`FixedTangentCellBijection`, Proposition 4.4 of the paper).
- `Recursion/` — the recursion universe: members, order defects, child members, return/exit events,
  termination, and the root cell law.
- `Assembly/` — type events and divisor counts, monic/projective cells, the Haar-null bridges from the
  original densities to the internal ones (`NullBridges`), and the density formulas (`Formulas`).
- `Reciprocity/` — independent of the surface tower (depends only on `Basic` and `Formula/`): series
  calculus, the quantum torus and reciprocal substitution, plethysm, pattern sums, the reciprocity law.
- `Main` — the main theorems.
- `Corollaries/` (v1.2) — nonnegativity of the universal expressions (`Nonneg`); the three laws as
  rational functions, Theorem 1.1 in one statement, and reciprocity as an endomorphism of `ℚ(q)` in
  every degree (`RationalForm`).

Internally the proof runs on route-F densities (`monicDensityF`, `projectiveDensityF`, defined at the
end of `Basic.lean`, which add the condition that integral closures in root fields are finite); the
bridges `orig_monicDensity_eq`, `orig_projectiveDensity_eq` show they agree with the published
densities because the exceptional loci are Haar-null.

## Provenance

Obtained from a certified tree of ~1200 one-theorem files (`final/monolith_gen`) by mechanical merging
along the usage DAG and three golfing cycles (see `CHANGELOG.md`, `CAPTAIN.md`, `HANDOFF.md`). Module docstrings end
with a `Provenance:` line naming the original nodes.
